      <h1>Giftdriver</h1>
      <p>Giftdriver streamlines the Adopt-a-Family and donation gift-giving process for organizations supporting youth and families through the holiday season. Families in need receive material support, and both those giving and receiving are provided opportunity to connect with other families in the community - all participating are provided opportunity to give at a time of year when abundance is celebrated.</p>

      <p>Giftdriver was a student project with purpose. We used our learning as an opportunity to give back to our community. Our hope? Giftdriver will provide a platform to help organization help more families each year by making it easier for donors to get and stay connected to Adopt-a-Programs. A big thanks to Brighter Beginnings, the Bay Area non-profit that help guide our process around deciding on the application's UI and many features.</p>

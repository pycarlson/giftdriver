      <h1>Giftdriver</h1>
      <p>Our generosity-powered software for organizing gift drives is a simple tool to help non-profit organizations working that run Adopt-a-Family gift drives parle more earsily with their donors. </p>

      <p>Originally a student project to complete their training to become full stack developers, a small team of three... worked in part in collaboration with a San Francisco Bay area youth and family support agency, Brighter Beginnings, to guide the process of choosing application features. After completing their education at Dev Bootcamp, the team who built Giftdriver continued to work on it so that it could launch for the holiday season of 2013.</p>
